 NEW_DECADE_COVID_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In China, a new mystery virus has emerged and has been named COVID-19, more commonly known simply as Coronavirus. This new virus is highly infectious and could very well spread beyond China's borders and wreck the global economy and create divisive political and societal situations.

In the United States, an election is coming up with incumbent president Donald Trump being eligible for re-election, and it could harm America's political stability for the coming decade, no matter who wins."
